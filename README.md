# Codveda-ML-Task2-Linear-Regression
A simple Machine Learning project for predicting house prices using Linear Regression. The script loads the dataset, splits it into training/testing sets, trains the model, and evaluates performance with R² score and Mean Squared Error, while checking for overfitting.
